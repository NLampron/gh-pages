				<h3>Digging</h3>
				<p>The elusive woodchuck loves to dig. It creates homes underneath these holes, starting with the "plunge shoot" which is where the woodchuck goes to access his home. Within this mansion of a hole there are many other rooms, such as the waste chamber and the nursery chamber. These woodchucks are so advanced that they also have an area to turn around in. </p>
				<hr>
				<p> The woodchuck's hole is where it relaxes after a long day of digging, eating, and wood chucking.It's not easy being a woodchuck so they like to get some R&R when there isn't wood to be chucked.</p>

				<h2>Eating</h2>
				<img class="feat-img" src="http://woodstream.scene7.com/is/image/woodstream/hh-animals-groundhog-3?$ProductPgLarge2$">
				<p>The woodchuck enjoys a herbivorous menu, which includes grass, berries, and if they're lucky, a few other agricultural crops such as the peanut seen in the picture on the left. </p>
				<p>They are not very picky eaters though, they will eat mostly anything around them. There have been accounts of woodchucks eating an entire tree in one sitting. Their favorite trees are the elusive maple. </p>

				<h3>Wood Chucking?</h3>
				<p>"How much wood could a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood?"</p>
				<hr>
				<p>If you've ever wanted to know the answer to this age old question, you're in the right place. Richard Thomas had calculated the volume of dirt in a typical 25–30-foot (7.6–9.1 m) long woodchuck burrow, and had determined that if the woodchuck had moved an equivalent volume of wood, it could move "about 711 pounds (323 kg) on a good day, with the wind at his back"</p>
